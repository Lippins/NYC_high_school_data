    "# ANALYSING NYC HIGH SCHOOL DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "## BACKGROUND\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of the standardized tests, and whether they’re unfair to certain groups. An example of such standardized tests is the SAT, or **Scholastic Aptitude Test**, an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take SAT scores into account when deciding who to admit, hence having a high score is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "The test comprises three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the dataset for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Overview\n",
    "New York City makes its [data on high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online, as well as [the demographics for each high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2014-2015/n3p6-zve2). The first few rows of the SAT data look like this:\n",
    "![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/sat.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With access to this data, we can investigate the correlation between SAT scores and demographics. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more. Unfortunately, combining both of the datasets won't give us all of the demographic information we want to use. We'll need to supplement our data with other sources to conduct a comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the same website has several related datasets covering demographic information and test scores. Below are the links to all of the datasets we'll be using in our analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[SAT scores by school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4)** - SAT scores for each high school in New York City.\n",
    "2. **[School attendance](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Attendance-and-Enrollment-Statistics-by-Dis/7z8d-msnt)** - Attendance information for each school in New York City.\n",
    "3. **[Class size](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2010-2011-Class-Size-School-level-detail/urz7-pzb3)** - Information on class size for each school.\n",
    "4. **[AP test results](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/AP-College-Board-2010-School-Level-Results/itfs-ms3e)** - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject).\n",
    "5. **[Graduation outcomes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/Graduation-Outcomes-Classes-Of-2005-2010-School-Le/vh2h-md7a)** - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.\n",
    "6. **[Demographics](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Demographics-and-Accountability-Snapshot-20/ihfw-zy9j)** - Demographic information for each school.\n",
    "7. **[School survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/NYC-School-Survey-2011/mnz3-dyi8)** - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Goal\n",
    "All of these datasets are interrelated. If we can combine them into a single datasetwe may be able to evaluate for some correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "New York City has a significant immigrant population, and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to figure out if the SAT is a fair test. If certain racial groups consistently performed better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LIBRARIES\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by importing some useful python libraries. `Numpy` and `Pandas` for performing mathematical operations and manipulating data; `Tabulate` for pretty-printing pandas series and dataframes; the `Plotly` and `matplotlib` visualisation libraries for building informing visuals:"

    "From the first few rows of each dataset, we can make some observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Each dataset appears to either have a DBN column or the information we need to create one. That means we can use a DBN column to combine the datasets.*.\n",
    "- *Some fields look interesting for mapping, particularly Location 1, which contains coordinates inside a larger string*.\n",
    "- *Some of the datasets appear to contain multiple rows for each school (repeated DBN values), which means we’ll have to do some preprocessing to ensure that DBN is unique within each dataset.
